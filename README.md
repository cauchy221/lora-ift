# lora-ift

Code for lora instruction fine-tuning (on a pre-trained model). 

_Note: I use the same instruction template as the Alpaca dataset since the code is built on a pre-trained model. If you want to keep fine-tuning an sft model that is already trained on some instruction following dataset, please use the corresponding instruction template, and update the dataset class._
